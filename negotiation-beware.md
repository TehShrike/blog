# Beware tech companies who tell you they don't negotiate

Reddit and [Duck Duck Go][ddg] recently announced that they are [eliminating
salary negotiations][negotiation], in part to help even the playing field for
men and women, since [men are more likely to negotiate salaries than
women][negotiate-paper].

> Men negotiate harder than women do and sometimes women get penalized when

I am a little skeptical. It's fine for a company to announce this, but they
lose nothing from announcing "we don't negotiate offers". The person you really
need to ask is the person who has 5 offers from different tech companies. If
they go to Reddit or Duck Duck Go and say, "I'll come work for you for another
$5k / $10k with the same equity", are they turned down 100% of the time? If
yes, then I'll believe a company with a stated policy that says "we don't
reward negotiators".

Announcing "We give fair offers" is a smart move on behalf of a negotiator; it
lends better credibility to whatever offer is on the table. It's just not in
their best interest to disclose that they negotiate.

In my last round of job interviews, one company made me an offer, told me in
strong words that "this offer is non negotiable", then ended up offering me
both more salary and more equity.

I would also like to remind everyone that, within the last decade, [six of the
largest tech companies in the USA conspired to depress wages for engineering
employees][anti-poaching]. I will repeat that last sentence. SIX OF THE LARGEST
TECH COMPANIES IN THE USA ACTIVELY COLLUDED TO KEEP ENGINEERING SALARIES DOWN
FOR FIVE YEARS. Steve Jobs, a person who many tech CEO's admire and try to
emulate, [*threatened* Sergey Brin because Google was trying to recruit Safari
engineers][jobs].

Yes, Reddit and Duck Duck Go are not those companies, but if half
of the National League teams are found colluding, I'm going to have a little
skepticism when the Rangers tell me "this is the best offer you're going to
get". I almost forgot, that example doesn't even work, [because *all* of the
MLB owners recently colluded to depress salaries as well][mlb-collusion]. Given
the history, as a tech employee you are wise to take anything tech employers
say with a grain of salt.

I applaud Reddit and DDG for taking policy steps to address the gaps between
pay for men and women. They may find that starting with a high offer helps them
close candidates - great! But I am skeptical that "we don't negotiate" is true,
or at least, we're not hearing it from the right party in the negotiation.
