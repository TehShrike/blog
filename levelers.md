# Levelers

I read a great blog post in college, and sadly I can't find it now, so I'll
summarize. It showed a picture of Hearst Castle, and a photo of an average
middle-class home, and the text of the post went something like:

- One of these can travel across the country in 6 hours.

- One of these can communicate with friends and family on the other side of the
  country instantaneously.

- One of these can receive news from the other side of the globe instantaneously.

- One of these can watch movies in full color and sound in their own home.

- One of these can expect to live to age 80, and give birth to a child without
  serious risk of complications.

- One of these can wash an entire day's worth of dishes in 40 minutes with no
  human effort.

The point is, even though Hearst was one of the richest men on the planet, in
many ways the average middle class person today enjoys a better quality of
life, due to advancements in technology and medical science since the 1940's.

It's really exciting when technologies (air travel, the Internet, smartphones,
appliances) become accessible and cheap enough that everyone can enjoy them.
But it's even more exciting when the high end of the market comes within reach
of most people.

Let's say Bill Gates wants a better smartphone - say, with a longer battery,
or with a UI that does exactly what he wants. He's basically out of luck -
he can't throw enough money at the problem to get a better phone than what's
currently on the market. A phone you can afford is the best one that Bill
Gates can buy. I call products like these *levelers*, because they level
the playing field for everyone. It's easy to think of other examples - most
software/apps/websites, beers, movies, and more.

So I got excited yesterday when I read about [a product that might level
the playing field for another experience that's currently only for rich
people][jaunt].

Just like that - millions of people can suddenly all sit courtside for the NBA
Finals, or even hover above the court, and suddenly, my view of the game isn't
from section 400, it's as good as Jack Nicholson's.

This got me really excited for the future of virtual reality, and the new
things that people are going to build on top of it. I can't wait to see what
people build.
